module Adyen
  # The API module contains classes that interact with the Adyen SOAP API.
  #
  # You'll need to provide a username and password to interact with Adyen:
  #
  #     Adyen.configuration.api_username = 'ws@Company.MyAccount'
  #     Adyen.configuration.api_password = 'secret'
  #
  # Furthermore, you can setup default parameters, which will be used by every API call, by using
  # {Adyen::API.default_arguments}.
  #
  # The following classes, which handle the SOAP services, are available:
  #
  # * {PaymentService}   - for authorisation of, and modification to, payments.
  # * {RecurringService} - for handling recurring contract details.
  #
  # *However*, direct use of these classes is discouraged in favor of the shortcut methods defined
  # on the API module. These methods *require* that you set the :merchant_account *beforehand* as
  # a default parameter passed in all API calls:
  #
  #     Adyen.configuration.default_api_params[:merchant_account] = 'MerchantAccount'
  #
  # For Rails apps, you can also set it `application.rb` config block, like this:
  #
  #     config.adyen.default_api_params = { :merchant_account => 'MerchantAccount' }
  #
  # Note that you'll need an Adyen notification PSP reference for some of the calls. Because of
  # this, store all notifications that Adyen sends to you. Moreover, the responses to these calls
  # do *not* tell you whether or not the requested action was successful. For this you will also
  # have to check the notification.
  #
  # = Authorising payments
  #
  # To authorise payments, not recurring ones, the customers payment details will have to pass
  # through your application’s infrastucture. Because of this you will have to contact Adyen and
  # provide the necessary paperwork which says that you’re PCI DSS compliant, before you are given
  # access to Adyen’s API.
  #
  # Unless you are going to process over twenty thousand payments anually, the PCI DSS
  # Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) type A will _probably_ suffice.
